'''
When purchasing tickets, we always need to know the buyer's first name and last name. 
Create two string variables to store the ticket buyer's first name and last name.

Tasks:
Declare a variable first_name and assign it a first name.
Declare a variable last_name and assign it a last name.
Expected result:
After executing the program, you should have two variables: first_name and last_name, each containing the respective part of your name.

Tips:
Remember that string values in Python must be enclosed in quotes.
Choose a first name and last name that you would like to use for this task.

# Declare and assign the first name to the variable first_name
first_name = "Viktoriia"

# Declare and assign the last name to the variable last_name
last_name = "Kratser"

# Print the variables to confirm their contents
print("First Name:", first_name)
print("Last Name:", last_name)
