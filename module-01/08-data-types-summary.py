'''
Create four variables of different data types in Python with corresponding values.

Tasks:
Declare a variable name as a string and assign it a textual value.
Declare a numerical variable age and assign it an integer value.
Declare a Boolean variable is_active and assign it one of the Boolean values True or False.
Declare a variable subscription and set its value to None to indicate the absence of value.
Expected result:
After executing the program, you should have four variables: name, age, is_active, subscription, 
each representing a different data type.

# Declare a string variable 'name' and assign a textual value

# Declare a Boolean variable 'is_active' and assign a Boolean value
is_active = True

# Declare a variable 'subscription' and assign None to indicate absence of value
subscription = None

# Print the values and types of each variable to verify their types and contents
